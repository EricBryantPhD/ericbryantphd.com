Great news everyone!
Having recently completed my PhD at Columbia University, I am excited to
announce that I am officially on the job market!

If you are looking to hire a post-doc with expertise in bioinformatics &
molecular biology, an interest in reproducible analysis workflows, and a passion
for genetic interaction networks, then I might be a good fit for your lab!

If you would like to know more about my background, please see my [CV](cv).

If you would like to know more about my thesis work, please see my post on 
the [systems genetics of DNA damage tolerance](2020/01/09/phd-dissertation), 
which includes links to relevant publications and informal introductions to the
topics covered in my dissertation.
