<h2>About myself</h2>
<p>My CV is available to read <a href="cv">here</a>, or download <a href="cv#downloads">here</a>.</p>
<p>To read about my thesis work, please see my post on the
<a href="2020/01/09/phd-dissertation">systems genetics of DNA damage tolerance</a>,
which includes links to
<a href="cv#publications">my publications</a>,
<a href="2020/01/09/phd-dissertation#preface">informal introductions to the topics covered in my dissertation</a>, and
<a href="2020/01/09/phd-dissertation#discussion">discussion of key insights from my PhD</a>.</p>

<div id="what-am-i-looking-for" class="section level2">
<h2>What am I looking for?</h2>
<p>While my predoctoral work was focused on molecular biology methods at a gene
synthesis startup company, and my doctoral work was a balance between yeast
genetics and bioinformatics, my ideal postdoctoral position would allow me to
focus more specifically on bioinformatics work.</p>
<p>I am especially interested in projects involving the measurement, and
interpretation of genetic interaction profiles/networks using CRISPR methods,
which would be a natural extension of my thesis work (discussed briefly
<a href="2020/01/09/phd-dissertation/#the-crispr-revolution-systems-genetics-in-new-model-systems">here</a>).</p>
<p>My PhD focused on cancer genetics, synthetic lethality, and DNA repair, so
these areas would involve a smaller startup cost for me.
However, I am not afraid of diving into other areas of biology
(the biggest skill gained during a PhD might just be the ability to quickly
familiarize oneself with an unfamiliar topic).</p>
<p>I am also open to projects that are completely different from my thesis work.
For example, I very much enjoyed collaborating on microscopy studies of
chromosome mobility.
Additionally, perhaps stemming from my time working as a gene synthesis
technician, I hold a strong interest in genome and protein engineering
projects, especially those involving directed evolution and synthetic biology.</p>
<p>All that said, if you have a project that you are excited about and you think
I might be even remotely interested, please reach out and let‚Äôs have a fun
chat!</p>

<h2>Beyond the postdoc?</h2>
<p>This is somewhat in the ‚Äúdream‚Äù category for me at the moment, but I would
love to develop and teach an introductory course on reproducible data analysis
methods targeted at the community college level.
The course would draw heavy inspiration from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Bryan">Jenny Bryan</a>‚Äôs
<a href="https://stat545.com">Stat 545 course</a>, and
case studies in data analysis a la
<a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">Tidy Tuesday</a>.</p>
<p>While I find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOCs</a>
inspiring for their potential to reach millions of people, I know that I and
many others still benefit greatly from in-person instruction.
I think this is especially true for those who are intimidated by computing.
I consider reproducible data analysis a foundational skill for current and
future researchers, journalists and scientists.
As such, I consider community colleges to be the ideal place for students
beginning their careers, and people in established careers, to brush up
on these modern data science methods with accessible and affordable in-person
instruction.</p>
<p>If you would like to work with or support me on this endeavor, we should talk!</p>
